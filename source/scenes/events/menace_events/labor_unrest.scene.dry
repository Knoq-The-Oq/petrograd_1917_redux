= Labor Unrest

A wave of strikes is roiling Russia's factories. The revolution has given workers the right to organize and strike, and pent-up economic demands are finally expressing themselves. The ongoing inflation is a great source of concern among workers, along with the stagnation of industrial wages. Workers also seek more control over the means of production.

What can we do?

@suppress
title: Suppress the labor unrest, with force if needed!
subtitle: Use the city militias and loyal troops if we must. This will be dangerous.
unavailable-subtitle: The city militias are not strong enough.

We have given the order to suppress the strikes with force if necessary. And force was used. This is a dark day in Russian history, another Bloody Sunday, an action that one would think only the Tsars would commit.

Many members of the city militia have chosen to resign rather than commit another action such as this.

@8_hour
title: The Provisional Government should legislate the 8-hour workday.
view-if: ((player_party = "k" and k_in_gov) or (player_party = "m" and m_in_gov) or (player_party = "sr" and sr_in_gov)) and workday = 0
on-arrival: monthly_inflation += 0.2; capital_flight_progress += 1; workers_m += 5*(1-m_dissent) if m_in_exco; workers_sr += 5*(1-sr_dissent) if sr_in_exco; workers_b += 5*(1-b_dissent) if b_in_exco; m_k_relation -= 4 if m_in_exco; sr_k_relation -= 4 if sr_in_exco; prov_gov_soviet_cooperation -= 0.02; income += 1; labor_unrest -= 3;

@concessions
title: The Provisional Government should negotiate minor concessions by both sides.
view-if: ((player_party = "k" and k_in_gov) or (player_party = "m" and m_in_gov) or (player_party = "sr" and sr_in_gov))
on-arrival: monthly_inflation += 0.05; workers_m += 2*(1-m_dissent) if m_in_gov; workers_sr += 2*(1-sr_dissent) if sr_in_gov; workers_b += 2*(1-b_dissent) if b_in_gov; workers_k += 2*(1-k_dissent) if k_in_gov; income += 1; labor_unrest -= 2; industry *= 1.01; unemployed += 0.1

We have negotiated for minor concessions from employers, and some tactical retreat by the workers. The workers are not entirely happy about the deals, but they see us as on their side, for now.

@soviet_help
title: The Soviet should support the workers' demands for higher wages and improved working conditions.
view-if: ((player_party = "b" and b_in_exco) or (player_party = "m" and m_in_exco) or (player_party = "sr" and sr_in_exco) or (player_party = "k" and k_in_exco))
on-arrival: monthly_inflation += 0.1; capital_flight_progress += 1; workers_m += 5*(1-m_dissent) if m_in_exco; workers_sr += 5*(1-sr_dissent) if sr_in_exco; workers_b += 5*(1-b_dissent) if b_in_exco; m_k_relation -= 4 if m_in_exco; sr_k_relation -= 4 if sr_in_exco; prov_gov_soviet_cooperation -= 0.02; income += 1; labor_unrest -= 3; unemployed += 0.6

We have supported the workers in their economic demands and their struggles with their employers. Strikes are ended with agreements favorable to workers. The employers are somewhat displeased, and higher wages without increased production can lead to more inflation.

@soviet_stop
title: The Soviet should convince the workers to stop striking.
view-if: ((player_party = "b" and b_in_exco) or (player_party = "m" and m_in_exco) or (player_party = "sr" and sr_in_exco) or (player_party = "k" and k_in_exco))
on-arrival: workers_m -= 4 if m_in_exco; workers_sr -= 4 if sr_in_exco; workers_b -= 4 if b_in_exco; workers_b += 5 if not b_in_exco; labor_unrest -= 3; production *= 1.02;

The Soviet propaganda organs exhort the workers to stop striking for the sake of stability and unity. Eventually the workers do stop, but the Soviet parties are tainted in the eyes of the workers.

@support
title: Support the strikes rhetorically.
view-if: (player_party = "b" or player_party = "m" or player_party = "sr")
on-arrival: labor_unrest -= 1; monthly_inflation += 0.1;

We have supported the strikers with our propaganda, without taking any actions. This might absolve us of any responsibility for their success or failure.


@nothing
title: There is nothing we can do.
on-arrival: workers_m -= 6 if player_party = "m"; workers_sr -= 6 if player_party = "sr"; workers_b -= 6 if player_party = "b"; workers_k -= 6 if player_party = "k";

There is nothing we can do. The strikes end by themselves, with negotiations from both sides.
